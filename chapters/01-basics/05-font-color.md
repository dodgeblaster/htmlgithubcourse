## Exercise
#### Assignment: Font and Color - 10%
Create 5 pages. Each page is going to have a header, hr, and paragraph text. Each page is going to have a different theme. You need to choose a font pairing from google fonts, and a color pairing that matches the theme. The themes are:

- Sophisticated
- Energetic
- Relaxed
- Corporate
- Fun

You must specify what strategy you are using for color. Here are the options:

- One Color
- Analogous
- Complementary
- Split Complementary
- Triad
- Material Design

I will be giving 5 points for each page for a total of 25 points:

- 1 - Is the HTML and CSS properly indented
- 2 - Do all the links work on the page
- 3 - Are the fonts properly imported
- 4 - Is the font easy to read
- 5 - Are you using one of the strategies we went over for color
