## Exercise
For this exercise, we are going to build on what we learned in the previous section. We will start by making 5 sections in our html, (header, hero, 3tiles, main section, footer), and then fill each section in. The hero div will have a background image, and the 3 tiles will use an html img tag. Use a picture from unsplash. The font used in the mock is 'Lato' from google fonts.
