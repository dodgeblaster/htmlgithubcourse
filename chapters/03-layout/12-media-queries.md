# 12. Media Queries

## Schedule

- Introduce topic with slides
- Demonstrate with code
- Exercise

## Exercise
Take either the Inline Method project or Float project, and apply medium and small media queries to the four columns so they properly fit at all sizes. For example, at medium width there could be 2 divs instead of 4 across, and at small width every div takes up 100%.
