## Things we need

### 1. You will need an editor

Any editor will do. If you are already comfortable with a certain editor, feel free to use it. If you have never coded before, I suggest using VS Code, that will be the editor I will be using in this course.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2. You will need some browsers

We will primarily be using the chrome web browser for this course, but its a good idea to have a few browsers installed. Here are a few you should get:
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
[FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
[Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
